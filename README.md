Metrocar Funnel Analysis Project
Overview

Welcome to the Metrocar Funnel Analysis Project! In this project, we analyze the customer funnel of Metrocar, a ride-sharing app akin to Uber/Lyft. Our goal is to identify areas for improvement and optimization using SQL queries and data visualization techniques.
Funnel Analysis

Funnel analysis helps us track and understand the sequential steps users take when interacting with Metrocar. The funnel stages include App Download, Signup, Request Ride, Driver Acceptance, Ride, Payment, and Review. By pinpointing drop-off points, we can enhance user experience and boost conversions.
